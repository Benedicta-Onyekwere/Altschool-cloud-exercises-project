## CLONING ALTSCHOOL-CLOUD-EXERCISES-PROJECT FROM GITHUB TO GITLAB 
I started this exercise by creating a Gitlab account, after which i cloned my Altschool-cloud-exercises-project to it. I used the following steps to achieve this:
<ol>
<li>From the top navigation bar in Gitlab,i clicked on select New project.</li><br>
<li>Then i selected the Import project tab and then clicked on GitHub. This showed me a list of my repositories on Github, so i selected Altschool-cloud-exercise-project.</li><br>
<li>I was redirected to a page on Github to authorize the Gitlab application</li><br>
<li>After i authorized i was redirected back to Gitlab where my Altschool-cloud-exercises -project repository has been cloned and deposited.</li><br>

</ol>
I set up my name and email in Git's global config using the following commands:

`git config --global user.name "Benedicta Onyekwere"`

`git config --global user.email onyekwere benedicta@gmail.com`

The following are the output of git commands:
<ul>
<li>

`git config -l`
